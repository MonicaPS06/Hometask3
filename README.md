## Matriculation Number:
- 7221964

## Description:
This project implements a vehicle and engine hierarchy in Java. The program consists of a superclass `Vehicle` with three subclasses (`ICEV`, `BEV`, `HybridV`). Each subclass is associated with a `Manufacture` and an `Engine` (subclasses include `CombustionEngine`, `ElectricEngine`, and `HybridEngine`). The program demonstrates the `ShowCharacteristics()` method which displays details about each vehicle.

### Features:
- Inheritance hierarchy for `Vehicle` and `Engine`.
- `Manufacture` class with getters and setters.
- Demonstrates vehicle characteristics using the `ShowCharacteristics()` method.
- Vehicle array containing different types of vehicles (`ICEV`, `BEV`, `HybridV`).

### Development Environment:
